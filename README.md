# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Installation 

Start with these commands in your terminal:

- npm install
- npm install axios
- npm install prop-types (due to this project not using typescript)

then: - npm run dev
